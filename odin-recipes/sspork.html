   <!-- description -->
   <p>Sweet and sour pork is a traditional and delicious Chinese dish. There's no need for takeout when you can make it with very little effort at home, and even better, in the Instant Pot®. Serve with rice.</p>

   <!-- ingredients -->
   <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound boneless pork loin, cut into 3/4-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups water, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>⅓ cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup pineapple juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>aluminum foil</li>
        <li>1 onion, vertically sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh pineapple</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (Optional)</li>
   </ul>

   <!-- steps -->
   <ol>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add oil and heat until hot. Add pork cubes, working in batches if necessary, and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Return all the pork back to the pot and cancel Saute mode.</li>
        <li>Whisk together 3/4 cup water, ketchup, rice vinegar, pineapple juice, brown sugar, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic in a small bowl. Pour over pork and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Release remaining pressure using the quick-release method. Unlock the lid and remove. Transfer pork to a plate using a slotted spoon. Cover with foil to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Select Saute mode and stir in onion, pineapple, and red and green bell peppers. Simmer until vegetables start to soften, 6 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk together cornstarch and remaining 1/2 cup water in a small bowl until smooth. Pour slurry into the pot. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce has thickened to your preferred consistency, about 2 minutes. Return cooked pork back to the pot and heat until just warmed through. Garnish with sesame seeds.</li>
